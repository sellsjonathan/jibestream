## Description of the project

This project is a demonstration of integrating the Google maps API within a React application.

This application allows users to search a Google map, and have it jump to a queried area. The application also makes use of Google maps autocomplete to help users find relavent places to position the map to.


## Main dependencies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project uses [google-maps-react](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react) to wrap the Google maps API.

## How to initialize

As per [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), run `npm start` or `yarn start` from your console to compile and run the application, which after compilation, will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.
